// In Kotlin, you can define a class inside another class, which is known as a nested class.
// By default, nested class is static so we can access the nested class property or variables using dot(.) notation
// without creating an object of the class.

// Nested class in Kotlin are equivalent to Static Nested Class in JAVA.

/*
    Nested class canâ€™t access the members of the outer class, but we can access the property of nested class
    from the outer class without creating an object for nested class.
