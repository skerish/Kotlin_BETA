/*
    An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is meant to be subclassed. An abstract class may
    contain both abstract methods(methods without a body) and concrete methods(methods with a body).

        1. We canâ€™t create an object for abstract class.
        2. All the variables(properties) and member functions of an abstract class are by default non-abstract.
            So, if we want to override these members in the child class then we need to use open keyword.
        If we declare a member function as abstract, then we do not need to annotate with open keyword because these
        are open by default. An abstract member function does not have a body, and it must be implemented in the derived class.

abstract class PS_Employee(val name: String, val experience: Int) {   // Non-Abstract

    // Abstract Property (Must be overridden by Subclasses)
    abstract var salary: Double

    // Abstract Methods (Must be implemented by Subclasses)
    abstract fun dateOfBirth(date:String)

    // Non-Abstract Method
    fun employeeDetails() {
        println("Name of the employee: $name")
        println("Experience in years: $experience")
        println("Annual Salary: $salary")

    }
